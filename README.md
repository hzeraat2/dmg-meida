Task
We'd like to track scroll depth through a news article webpage. When a user scrolls their window to 25%, 50%, 100% of the article body we'd like to inform them of their current progress.
Write a JavaScript program that will dispatch an event to the window object at each of these scroll offsets. Include the offset percentage in the details of the event.
You may choose a design pattern that you think is most appropriate for this task and can explain in interview.
Please use the following article as input. We should be able to load your JS program on to the page for testing.
